/* pause_screen.h -- state machine of the pause screen (UI_pause.fng): entry list, icon carousel,
 * activation timing and confirmation dialogs (SPEC_GUI_ART 2, tvg07/tvg08/tvg10/tvg11).
 *
 * GL-free and SDL-free; draws nothing. The host adapter (pause_menu.c) maps devices to PsInput,
 * advances time, polls PsEvent and presents the state through the authored package (gui_view.h).
 * "After exit" entries run the screen's 320 ms exit script first and act at exit-complete;
 * "immediate" entries act at once or open a confirmation dialog. */
